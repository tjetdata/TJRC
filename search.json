    "text": "The Transitional Justice Research Collaborative began with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) in June 2010, and it ceased updating in 2018. Members of the project, Geoff Dancy and Kathryn Sikkink, will soon go live with a new database called the Transitional Justice Evaluation Tools (TJET). TJET will present data updates on transitional justice mechanisms through 2020.\nThe main purpose of the Transitional Justice Research Collaborative was to produce data and use the data to understand the impact of justice mechanisms on human rights and democracy around the world.\nThe two principal investigators for this project were Professor Leigh Payne, at the Sociology Department and at the Latin American Centre at the University of Oxford, and Professor Kathryn Sikkink, professor emeritus at the Department of Political Science at the University of Minnesota, and the Ryan Family Professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. From 2010-2013, the Transitional Justice Research Collaborative collected and analyzed detailed data about three main transitional justice mechanisms: human rights prosecutions, truth commissions, and amnesty laws. Beginning in June 2010, the project operated under the joint direction of Geoff Dancy and Francesca Lessa, with Bridget Marchesi joining them in 2012. In addition to the directors, many graduate students and now assistant professors have performed invaluable services as coders, individual project directors, and consultants. Together, the team has generated coding instruments, web-based entry techniques, research methods, and data analysis for the three mechanisms under examination. For a full listing of our dedicated coders, project directors, and consultants, see People.\nThe Transitional Justice Research Collaborative built off the earlier work of Payne and Sikkink’s two previous research teams. The first was the Transitional Justice Data Base project in the Department of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the second was the Transitional Human Rights Trials project in the Department of Political Science at the University of Minnesota. The research at the University of Wisconsin culminated in the publication of a book co-authored by Tricia Olsen, Leigh Payne and Andrew Reiter: Transitional Justice in Balance: Comparing Processes, Weighing Efficacy (Washington, DC: United States Institute of Peace Press, 2010) and numerous journal articles. The research at the University of Minnesota produced journal articles authored by Hun Joon Kim, Carrie Booth-Walling, and Kathryn Sikkink, as well as Kathryn Sikkink’s 2011 book The Justice Cascade: How Human Rights Prosecutions are Changing World Politics (New York: W.W. Norton). For a list of publications using the Transitional Justice Research Collaborative data, see Findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant Nos.

    "text": "This website is meant for scholars and practitioners who wish to examine the causes and impacts of mechanisms that address human rights violations. It was founded to present the work of the Transitional Justice Research Collaborative (TJRC), which ceased operating in 2018.\nComprised of principal researchers from University of Oxford, University of Minnesota and Harvard University, TJRC presented data on three primary transitional justice mechanisms—human rights prosecutions, truth commissions, and amnesties—for 109 democratic transitions in 86 countries around the world, from 1970-2012. While by no means complete, the dataset includes the most comprehensive single collection of information on these mechanisms for countries around the world. With the support of the National Science Foundation and the Arts and Humanities Research Council, the data were collected from a variety of sources by more than 25 coders over a three-year period. As we complete our data collection and data processing activities, additional data will be made publicly available including new data on human rights prosecutions, vetting and reparations.

    "text": "NOTE: The data on TJRC are not all downloadable at once. TJRC researchers make various datasets to answer particular questions, and then we release those for replication and reuse. To understand in greater detail, see this excerpt from Geoff Dancy and Kathryn Sikkink, “The Data of Transitional Justice.” In preparation for The Oxford Handbook of Transitional Justice.\n“What does the final database look like? This is a question worth answering because it is the source of misunderstanding. The TJRC database is not exclusively quantitative. It is also not frozen; instead, it sits in constant flux between being and becoming. For technical researchers, the database is a relational MySQL data matrix comprised of many rows and columns that sits on an online server. It contains tens of thousands of discrete pieces of information, some words and some numbers, which are separated from each other by commas. For qualitative researchers, the database also contains a wealth of narrative information about such issues as the historical origins of transitional justice policies, the names of victims and the accused in prosecutions, the scope of amnesty policies, and the mandate of the truth commissions. These data can be viewed with a built-in browse function.\nTJRC researchers have sampled from the main database to compile offshoot events-history datasets that use additive count measures within each country-year,. This provides much richer information about the actual number of prosecutions, amnesties, truth commissions, and reparations policies in a country (Dancy et al. 2019). These data sets also include information on the quality and outcomes of the processes. For example, we are exploring various ways to measure the robustness of truth commissions based on various observable properties of each body. This would produce something like a truth commission performance indicator” that captures variation in quality across cases.\nThe TJRC developed a relational database because of the sheer amount and variety of information that needed to be handled. There are different ways of sampling countries (democratic or post-conflict transitions), different mechanisms, and different outcomes of interest (repressive violence, democratic consolidation, etc.). With relational data, all of these data can be kept in separate rooms within the same house, and brought together when and if it is time to meet.\nThe drawback of the relational approach is that it is non-intuitive and difficult to understand. One common misconception is that the database has one single structure with unchanging content. Scholars often write to ask for a copy of the TJRC dataset, an understandable request that is also unfulfillable, technically speaking, since the database is a digitally housed collection of many datasets that can be queried to create any number of data files. This means that we have to respond to interested researchers with a question: what data would you like? Often, though, they just want to peruse, or scroll through, the data. For this reason, the TJRC’s web developers created tabbed filters that allow users to browse that data. One can automatically filter the database to view mechanisms by country, year, regime, civil war context, and crimes covered. Still, users’ most common impulse is to ask for a single complete dataset that they can view in their most preferred applications. One does not exist—nor does a single master list, or count, of transitional justice processes. What does exist, instead, are a series of data sets that the TJRC project members have sampled, extracted, and frozen in particular moments for the purpose of analysis.\nThe benefit of the relational approach to database creation—wherein a variety of pieces of information are stored online and wait for the user to fit them into a structure—is that it allows the data to remain flexible, and adaptable to purpose. One can design a data set to answer specific questions, e.g. Does holding more human rights prosecutions amid civil war prolong hostilities? To answer this question, one must query the database to provide list of cases in which civil war is ongoing, and accompany that list with a quantitative indicator of how many prosecutions occur amid fighting (see Dancy and Wiebelhaus-Brahm 2018). In another example, the TJRC collected data on over 6,000 records on domestic criminal prosecutions, but in our most extensive study on the impact of transitional justice in democratizing states, we include information on only 555 trials. This pruning was theory-driven. The point of this study was to analyze the impact on future patterns of repressive violence caused by more extensive efforts at prosecuting former state agents after a democratic transition (Dancy et al. 2019). So we had to select in only those prosecutions based on context (following democratic transition), accused (whether they were state agents in the previous regime), harms (which must be human rights violations), and evidentiary validity (whether the trial event was verified by two or more sources). Theory-driven dataset generation of this type allows for the most accurate analyses of research questions. Too often in social science, scholars allow data availability to guide inquiry; one answers questions for which one possesses reliable data. This may limit progress because it means that scholars continue to pick over the same data to find minor relationships (Schrodt 2014). Overcoming this problem in the future means unfreezing information and allowing research questions to guide data set creation.”\nCited Research:\nDancy, Geoff, and Eric Wiebelhaus-Brahm. 2018. “The Impact of Criminal Prosecutions during Intrastate Conflict.” Journal of Peace Research 55 (1): 47–61.\nDancy, Geoff, Bridget Marchesi, Tricia Olsen, Leigh A.

    "text": "Why did you select these three mechanisms—trials, truth commissions, and amnesties\nState governments acting to right the wrongs of the past in the wake of democratic transitions have a number of justice policy options available. We have collected extensive data on these three mechanisms because they are the most grounded in the theoretical literature on transitional justice, and they remain the most common in practice. Even further, while the 1990s and 2000s saw an overwhelming increase in the use of these mechanisms, little effort has been made to systematically gauge their impacts. Our data is meant to help address this deficit in cross-national analysis.\n\n\nHow did you select which countries to include in the browse?\nNot all of the countries of the world are included in our browse. We do not even include all of the countries for which we have collected data. The expressed purpose of the data presented on this website is to enable analysis of the impact of international and domestic transitional justice efforts among countries in the wake of democratic transition. For us, this means excluding events that take place in non-democratic and non-transitional contexts. To determine whether a country can be classified as “transitional,” we carefully reviewed regime type data collected by the Polity IV Project at the University of Maryland. See the file “Democratic Transitions” on the Download page of our site.\nAll of those countries that experienced at least one democratic transition, or emerged as a new democratic state were included in our sample. We begin our sample with the year 1970 since transitional justice is often seen as an issue that emerged with the Third Wave of Democratization and because human rights-related data prior to this year are unreliable.\nThese countries remained in our sample as long as they did not revert back to authoritarian rule. In the event that they did revert, the years under autocracy were excluded, though the country years under democracy remain in our dataset. In the event that a country experienced multiple transitions—meaning that it transitioned to democracy, reverted to autocracy, and again transitioned to democracy—only those country years falling under democratic rule were included in the dataset.\nTherefore, the countries you see in the browse, and the corresponding data, take place in post-transitional, and at least minimally democratic, contexts.

The transitional status of justice mechanisms can only be defined in terms of time and space or political context. Thus, to mark ‘transitional’ mechanisms, we create scope conditions and definitional criteria that delimit which actions are occurring during institutional or political flux.\nFor a human rights trial to be transitional it must occur after the democratic transition and it must seek remedy for crimes that were committed prior to that transition. In addition, the accused must be state agents, who have engaged in violations of physical integrity.\nFor a truth commission to be transitional it must similarly have occurred in the wake of transition and it must endeavor to provide truth for state crimes that took place under autocratic rule.\nFinally, for an amnesty to be considered transitional, it must seek indemnity for state actions under autocratic rule. A critical exception exists for our coding of amnesties; an amnesty can be considered transitional even if it was passed prior to democratic transition.\n\n\nWhat is a human rights trial or prosecution?\nWe define a human rights criminal prosecution as “the use of domestic, foreign, or international courts of law to bring criminal procedures–including preliminary trial processes, trial hearings, or verdict and sentencing–against state agent perpetrators of human rights violations.” Human rights prosecutions encompass a variety of actions made by a number of actors. They have also been called human right trials, and they can include actions taken by the International Criminal Court (ICC) or ad hoc tribunals (as in the Slobodan Milosevic trial); foreign courts bringing charges against nationals of another country (as in the Augusto Pinochet case); or domestic courts bringing charges against their own nationals (as in Guatemala’s Rios Montt trial).\n\n\nWhy do you use quantitative instead of qualitative data?\nWe resist this distinction. Our project is often considered to be ‘quantitative’ because we have used numerical coding to analyze developments in cross-national time-series data sets. However, our work is not exclusively, or even primarily, quantitative. Nearly all of our coding work has involved scouring information in governmental, non-governmental, and journalistic accounts. We then generate a narrative account that is then categorized and input into a number of electronic data entry fields.\n\n\nWhat are your sources?\nWe primarily rely on US State Department Human Rights Reports as a starting point for our research on trials. We chose to do so because these reports provide an uninterrupted record of events in each country since the late 1970s and because the exclusive focus of these reports is on human rights practices.\nIn order to extend our information back to 1970, we used Keesing’s Record of World Events. This source, while extremely useful, demonstrates a tendency toward national security objectives. For example, many of the trials listed in Keesing’s refer to attempts to hold coup-leaders accountable for crimes against the state. Such actions do not fall within the purview of our analysis. However, we have still used Keesing’s to supplement the record kept by the US State Department.\nAfter coders read every US State Department report in search for at least one recorded instance of human rights trial activity, they made a list of all the country-years of the world that arguably contained transitional human rights trials. Next, all country-years coded as having a trial activity by Olsen et al. in Transitional Justice in Balance (2010) were added to the list. Coders then researched each instance further using Lexis Nexis Academic and other sources specific to each country.\nFor truth commissions, we started with three previous data compilations: Priscilla Hayner’s data in Unspeakable Truths, 2nd Edition, Dancy et al.’s (2010) Truth Commission Database, and truth commissions listed on the US Institute of Peace Website. Our coders then performed additional research on each case to arrive at the specific information needed to fill the record.\nFor amnesties, the team began with data collected by Louise Mallinder (2008), and supplemented the list with information from Olsen et al. in Transitional Justice in Balance (2010). They then performed additional research to arrive at more specific details.\n\n\nIs this a complete record of transitional justice events?\nNo, and we do not claim that it is. While we are confident that we have covered almost all truth commissions and amnesties, we cannot know whether we have captured all human rights trials that have taken place everywhere in the world. We collected 7,523 accused and 4,686 trial listings in 153 country jurisdictions, though we consider only 1,149 accused in 508 trials in 65 countries to be transitional in nature. Yet, despite these large numbers, we cannot know how many cases we have overlooked, or how much retrievable information is missing from the records. This is not necessarily a problem specific to our data, but a problem with all event history data. However, we have not let our desire to be comprehensive prevent us from being pragmatic, and we will release the data with the understanding that it is a never-ending work in progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant Nos.
